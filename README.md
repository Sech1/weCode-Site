weCode website for Spring 2018 weCode event at SIUE. <br />
weCode is a STEM outreach program for high school students to get some hands on experience learning how to code.  <br />
 <br />
I (Jared Schooley) updated the site for 2018, made the registration page, some new graphics, the registration confirmation emails,  <br />
and wrote the JS & PHP involved with handling the registration process and SQL back-end.  <br />
